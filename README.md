The chatbot uses ReactJS, NodeJs, Pinecone, Ngrok, Nginx, and OpenAI GPT-4 to manage and retrieve repository data efficiently. It tracks real-time changes via webhooks, updates a vector-based database (Pinecone), and processes user queries to provide accurate responses using cosine similarity and AI generation.
